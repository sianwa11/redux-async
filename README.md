# Redux asynchronous code

This is part of a series called 100 days of React where I try to document what I have learnt for 100 days. In this branch, I demonstrate how to run asynchronous code in redux in a simple manner without redux middleware.

[Here](https://dev.to/sianwa11/day-11-20-h4j) is a more detailed explanation in day 15 (Asynchronous code in Redux).
