# Redux-Middleware

This is part of a series called 100 days of React where I try to learn React in 100 days while doing small projects and explaining what I have learnt.

This branch shows my implementation of redux-middleware. The blog explaining this can be found on Day 16 [here](https://dev.to/sianwa11/day-11-20-h4j)
